<dt>What is Fliyr?</dt>
<dd>Fliyr is a free service that connects GT entrepreneurs with the skilled students and on-campus resources to develop their startup ideas.</dd>

<dt>What am I signing up for?</dt>

<dd>Signing up for Fliyr fully brings you into Georgia Techâ€™s entrepreneurial community. Right now, we are building a database of both future entrepreneurs and talented individuals with specific expertise.  

<br><br>Moving forward, Fliyr will feature an online bulletin board promoting Georgia Tech startups, job/co-founder postings, and the current resources and competitions the GT community provides.  Members will be able to view and contact the current startups being developed at Tech as well as reach out to other students that have the specialties needed to take their venture to next level.</dd>

<dt>How did you come up with the name Fliyr?</dt>

<dd>When facing the difficulty of finding the right startup team, one of the only ways to search for on-campus talent is to create and post a paper flier (or flyer). This approach is completely inefficient with the technology that we have today. Our service is the evolution of this method.</dd>
